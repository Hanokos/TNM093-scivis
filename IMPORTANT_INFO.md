To set up the project, you need the files I have here and the following:

pig.dat
pig.raw
.gitignore
start_httpserver_tp5023

Download these additional files from the lab files section on LISAM.

The only files that contain my own code are within the folders: mainfunc, func, and final.

IMPORTANT: Open mainfunc.js in Visual Studio Code, press Ctrl + F, and search for the word “OBS!!!”. It’s very important to understand these notes to see why we can switch to a Node-based system instead of a widget-based system.
