YOU NEED the files i have here and the following:
pig.dat,
pig.raw,
.gitignore and  
start_httpserver_tp5023

These files you get from downloading from LISAM given file from lab files.
The only files I have made any own code in are within mainfunc, func, and final

the imporatn is to ro press crl+f within visual studio code in teh mainfunc.js file and search for the word OBS!!!. its very important to understand why we can to the node version instead of widget based system
