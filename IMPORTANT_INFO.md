YOU NEED the files I have here and the following:
pig.dat,
pig.raw,
.gitignore and  
start_httpserver_tp5023

These files you get from downloading from LISAM given file from lab files.
The only files I have made any own code in are within mainfunc, func, and final

the VERY IMPORTANT is to press crl+f within visual studio code in the mainfunc.js file and search for the word OBS!!!. it's very important to understand why we can go to the node version instead of widget-based system
